## Raspberry Pi cluster with MPI

#### Description

This repository documents how to create a Raspberry Pi cluster with for high performance computing using MPI. It was done as our final project for High Performance Computation course at NYU in Spring 2017 semester under Georg Stadler.

The main steps to follow are in `docs/Setup.md` along with other helpful documents. All steps can also be executed using the scripts in the `scripts` directory of this repo. Any configuration and service files used are also included in this repo in the `etc` directory.

There are also some benchmark scripts available in the benchmarks folder. These were executed to benchmark performance of the cluster against other systems that we sued during the course.
